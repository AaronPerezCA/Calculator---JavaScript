* Your styling is fire!  I like the underglow as well.  I like your flashing loading display.  You have a fun design!  I definately see that you have front end skills.  <br>
* I see that you have the same issue that I had where  after pressing the equal button and then pressing a number key, it will append the pressed number to the string number.  A suggestion is in your equal button, clear the string that holds the number, clear the operator string and set the numbers equal to 0 so that you dont carry over information but the result still holds the result of the last computation.
